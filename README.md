# Server Resources for RGL.gg (serveme.tf Branch)

Hi! This github repository contains all of the **required** plugins, configs, maps, etc. for RGL league play.

This specific branch is intended to ONLY be used by Arie with serveme.tf. 

DO NOT USE THESE FOR MATCHES OR SCRIMS UNLESS YOU ARE ARIE FROM SERVEME.TF!

They have slightly modified values to better fit serveme's modus operandi.

If you're looking for the configs to download for your server, go [here](https://stephanielgbt.github.io/rgl-server-resources/).
